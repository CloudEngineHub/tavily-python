3. **Retrieve Current Date**: Capture the current date and pass it to the LLM in the next step.
4. **Generate Search Queries**: Request the LLM to create 3 concise search queries for Tavily to obtain additional information about the company (e.g., industry, ARR, CEO, CTO). Include the previously gathered data from the company website as context to prevent redundancy. Ask the LLM to incorporate important keywords related to the company to avoid retrieving information about a different company with the same name but in a different industry or domain.
