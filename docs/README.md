# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Prerequisites

To build and test documentation locally, begin by downloading and installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and then installing [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).
On Windows, you can install via the npm package manager (npm) which comes bundled with Node.js:

```console
npm install --global yarn
```

## Installation

Navigate to the docs folder and run:

```console
npm i
```

## Local Development

In the docs folder, run:

```console
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Building

In the docs folder, run:

```console
npm run build
npm run serve
```
